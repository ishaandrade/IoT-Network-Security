ML and DL approaches for IoT Network security
This design project addresses network security in large-scale IoT environments using machine learning. Four ML classifiers—logistic regression (LR), perceptron, AdaBoost, and random forest (RF)—were tested on the CICIoT2023 dataset. Results show that the RF classifier outperforms others with 99.75% accuracy for binary classification and 99.52% for multi-class classification. The RF model outperforms state-of-the-art ML techniques in detecting and classifying various IoT network attacks. Additionally, I presented two-layer CNN and LSTM models to perform perform binary and multi-class classification of malicious IoT network attacks.
